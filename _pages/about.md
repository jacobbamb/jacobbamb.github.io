Bonjour / Hej / Hi!

I am Jacob, a DPhil candidate at University of Oxford, supervised by [Professor Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) and [Professor Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/).
My research explores how tools from geometry, topology, and algebra -- particularly differential geometry -- can be used to tackle problems in modern deep learning, such as graph neural networks and generative models.

Before Oxford, I completed an MSc in Computer Science at EPFL.
In a previous life, I was an aspiring mathematician: I earned a BSc and an MSc in Mathematics from McGill, where I focused on geometric group theory under the supervision of [Professor Daniel Wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wise_(mathematician)). 

Along the way, I have also interned in various tech companies and startups, including [Giotto.ai](https://www.giotto.ai/) and [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/labs/labs/intro).
